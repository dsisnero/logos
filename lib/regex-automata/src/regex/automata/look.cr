  # Look-around assertion.
  #
  # An assertion matches at a position between characters in a haystack.
  # Namely, it does not actually "consume" any input as most parts of a regular
  # expression do. Assertions are a way of stating that some property must be
  # true at a particular point during matching.
  #
  # For example, `(?m)^[a-z]+$` is a pattern that:
  #
  # * Scans the haystack for a position at which `(?m:^)` is satisfied. That
  # occurs at either the beginning of the haystack, or immediately following
  # a `\n` character.
  # * Looks for one or more occurrences of `[a-z]`.
  # * Once `[a-z]+` has matched as much as it can, an overall match is only
  # reported when `[a-z]+` stops just before a `\n`.
  #
  # So in this case, `abc` and `\nabc\n` match, but `\nabc1\n` does not.
  #
  # Assertions are also called "look-around," "look-behind" and "look-ahead."
  # Specifically, some assertions are look-behind (like `^`), other assertions
  # are look-ahead (like `$`) and yet other assertions are both look-ahead and
  # look-behind (like `\b`).
